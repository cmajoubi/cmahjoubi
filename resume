I am Chakir Mahjoubi a linguist engineer working on syntactic and semantic annotation and lexicon development. I apply NLP features to evaluate and refine the language model for the improvement of computational language processing applications. My works have covered a wide range of topics taxonomies, translation and localization in different sectors; However, my research on linguistic and cultural studies have provided me with the opportunity to draw connections between different cultures to communicate difficult concepts.

RSEARCH INTEREST

Objectif and Projects
Language Resources for NLP (annotation, categorization, classification).
Defining content structural for taxonomies and Ontologies.
Practical knowledge of localization and internationalization.

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
