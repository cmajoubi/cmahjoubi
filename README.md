<h2 style="color:blue;">Profile</h2>
<p>I am Chakir Mahjoubi a linguist engineer working on syntactic and semantic annotation and lexicon development. I apply NLP features to evaluate and refine the language model for the improvement of computational language processing applications. My works have covered a wide range of topics taxonomies, translation and localization in different sectors; However, my research on linguistic and cultural studies have provided me with the opportunity to draw connections between different cultures to communicate difficult concepts.</p>

<h3>RSEARCH INTEREST</h3>
Terminology and Phraseology, Text Structure, Natural Language Processing; Lexical Ontologies; Stylistics; Pragmatics; Syntax; Semantics; Translation, Cultural Studies.

<h3>Objectif and Projects</h3>
Language Resources for NLP (annotation, categorization, classification).
Defining content structural for taxonomies and Ontologies.
Practical knowledge of localization and internationalization.

<h3>INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION</h3>
Volunteering member of the European Cooperation in Science & Technology (COST) open to linguist researchers, computer scientists collaborating in the field of science and technology, contributing to COST projects
Active member on the European research and educational projects (Text-Link), helping the organization in the development and validation of the terminology database.
